## Cross-Phase Integration

### Component Wiring

```
main.tsx
└── App.tsx
    └── Layout.tsx
        ├── Header.tsx (responsive, mobile menu)
        ├── children: HomePage.tsx
        │   ├── Banner.tsx (photo, name, title)
        │   └── Bio.tsx (description)
        └── Footer.tsx (scroll-reveal)
```

All 7 frontend components properly connected. No broken imports.

### Build Pipeline

| Command | Status |
|---------|--------|
| `bun install` | PASS |
| `bun run dev` | PASS (Vite on 5173) |
| `bun run build` | PASS (429 modules, 319KB) |
| `bun run type-check` | PASS (3 packages) |
| `bun run lint` | PASS (3 packages) |
| `bun run test` | PARTIAL (3/4 tests) |

### E2E Flow: Homepage

| Step | Component | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Visit site | main.tsx renders App | WORKS |
| See header | Layout renders Header immediately | WORKS |
| See banner | HomePage renders Banner (fades in 150ms) | WORKS |
| See bio | HomePage renders Bio | WORKS |
| Scroll to bottom | Layout reveals Footer | WORKS |

**Flow Status:** COMPLETE

## Tech Debt

### Phase 1: Monorepo Foundation

1. **Orphaned API exports** (by design)
   - `AppType` in packages/api/src/index.ts
   - `createSupabaseClient` in packages/api/src/db/supabase.ts
   - `createSupabaseAdmin` in packages/api/src/db/supabase.ts
   - **Note:** Backend infrastructure for future phases (v2+)

2. **Orphaned shared export**
   - `VERSION` in packages/shared/src/index.ts
   - **Note:** Was removed from App.tsx in Phase 3-02 (intentional cleanup)

### Phase 4: Home Page

1. **Stale test** (blocking test suite)
   - File: `apps/web/src/App.test.tsx` line 13-16
   - Issue: Tests for "en construccion" text that no longer exists
   - **Fix:** Update test to check for HomePage content or remove

2. **Placeholder content** (acceptable for v1.0)
   - Photo uses "AC" initials instead of real image
   - Footer social links are text placeholders
   - **Note:** Intentional - real content added when available

## Recommendations

### Before Completing Milestone

1. **Fix stale test** - Update `App.test.tsx` to test current HomePage content
   ```bash
   # The test currently fails:
   # AssertionError: expected false to be true
   # Test: "shows construction message"
   ```

### For v1.1+

1. Replace photo placeholder with real image
2. Add real social media links to Footer
3. Connect frontend to Hono API endpoints
4. Implement Supabase data fetching

## Conclusion

Milestone v1.0 MVP Foundation is **READY FOR COMPLETION** with one minor fix required:

- **28/28 requirements** satisfied
- **4/4 phases** verified
- **1 E2E flow** working
- **1 stale test** needs update (non-blocking for deployment)

The portfolio site is live at https://alvarocortes.vercel.app with:
- Professional header with navigation
- Banner showing name and job title
- Bio section with personal description
- Responsive design (desktop + mobile)
- Progressive loading animations
- Footer with scroll reveal
