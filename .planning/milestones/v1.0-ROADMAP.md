# Milestone v1.0: MVP Foundation

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-19
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 9

## Overview

Build a professional developer portfolio MVP with BHVR stack (Bun, Hono, Vite, React). Starting with monorepo foundation, then deployment pipeline to ship early, followed by layout system with progressive loading, and finally the responsive home page.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Monorepo Foundation

**Goal**: Working development environment with Bun workspaces, TypeScript, Vite, Hono, Supabase, and tooling
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: INFRA-01, INFRA-02, INFRA-03, INFRA-04, INFRA-05, INFRA-06, INFRA-07, INFRA-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `bun install` succeeds at repo root
  2. `bun dev` starts dev server for apps/web
  3. `bun test` runs Vitest across all packages
  4. `bun lint` checks code quality
  5. TypeScript compiles without errors
  6. Hono API package has type exports for RPC
  7. Supabase client configured in packages/api
**Plans**: 4 plans in 3 waves

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Monorepo Scaffolding (Wave 1) — Bun workspaces, Turborepo, TypeScript config
- [x] 01-02: Frontend Stack (Wave 2) — Vite 6, React 19, Tailwind v4
- [x] 01-03: Backend Stack (Wave 2) — Hono API, Supabase client, RPC types
- [x] 01-04: Tooling (Wave 3) — Vitest, ESLint, Prettier

### Phase 2: Deployment Pipeline

**Goal**: Site deploys automatically to Vercel on push to main
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: DEPLOY-01, DEPLOY-02, DEPLOY-03, DEPLOY-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Pushing to main triggers Vercel build
  2. Build succeeds and site is accessible at Vercel URL
  3. Environment variables (Supabase keys) available in runtime
  4. PR branches create preview deployments
**Plans**: 1 plan in 1 wave

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Vercel Deployment Setup (Wave 1) — Deploy apps/web with GitHub CI/CD

### Phase 3: Layout System

**Goal**: Header, footer, and progressive loading orchestration
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: LAYOUT-01, LAYOUT-02, LAYOUT-03, LAYOUT-04, LAYOUT-05, LOAD-01, LOAD-02, LOAD-03, LOAD-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Header appears immediately on page load with logo/name on left
  2. Header shows "Inicio" navigation link on right
  3. Footer is hidden until user scrolls to bottom
  4. Main content fades in smoothly with opacity transition
  5. No layout shifts during loading sequence
**Plans**: 2 plans in 2 waves

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Header & Footer Components (Wave 1) — Header with logo/name/nav, Footer with copyright
- [x] 03-02: Layout Orchestration (Wave 2) — Progressive loading with framer-motion

### Phase 4: Home Page

**Goal**: Complete responsive home page with banner and bio sections
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: HOME-01, HOME-02, HOME-03, RESP-01, RESP-02, RESP-03, RESP-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Banner displays photo, name, and job title
  2. Bio section shows personal description text
  3. Desktop layout optimized for 1024px+
  4. Mobile layout stacks sections vertically with adapted header
  5. Page uses Layout component with header/footer
**Plans**: 2 plans in 2 waves

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Home Page Content (Wave 1) — Banner, Bio, HomePage components
- [x] 04-02: Responsive Design (Wave 2) — Mobile hamburger menu, responsive layouts

## Progress

| Phase | Plans Complete | Status | Completed |
|-------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| 1. Monorepo Foundation | 4/4 | Complete | 2026-01-16 |
| 2. Deployment Pipeline | 1/1 | Complete | 2026-01-18 |
| 3. Layout System | 2/2 | Complete | 2026-01-19 |
| 4. Home Page | 2/2 | Complete | 2026-01-19 |

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Monorepo with Bun workspaces and Turborepo for orchestration
- Tailwind v4 @import syntax (modern approach)
- Mobile-first responsive with md: breakpoints
- 150ms content fade-in delay for perceived smoothness
- Footer scroll-reveal at 100px threshold
- Photo placeholder with initials (real image pending)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Turborepo 2.7 requires packageManager field
- Tailwind v4 uses @import instead of @tailwind directives
- Stale test updated after Phase 4 replaced placeholder content

**Technical Debt:**
- Orphaned API exports (backend infrastructure for future)
- Photo uses AC initials instead of real image
- Footer social links are placeholders
